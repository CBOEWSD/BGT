# User Interface

This folder contains base UI code, classes, libraries and generated documentation.

## Assets

Static asset directory for items like downloads, images, fonts, etc.

## Base

This is the base of the client side styles and JavaScript. In this folder we have our base includes/mixins for Sass and our base application classes for the client side code.

We also have a `_settings.scss` file located here which adds base variables to be used across the site in our stylesheets - things like branding colors, for example.

## Docs

This folder is generated by docco - ran from grunt task runner - giving us annotated documentation from all of our Coffee/JS files. To compile this folder run:

```
grunt docco
```

## Classes

This folder contains generic classes that can be applied site-wide. Generally, this is good for icons, text formatting and other such applications.

## Libs

This contains clientside libraries. We are using bower to manage our client side libraries. To install libraries run:

```
bower install
```

## Templates

Generated from `modules/**/*.share.handlebars` files to be used client side also. This can be compiled by running:

```
grunt handlebars
```

## Views

This folder contains view level styling.
