# User Interface

This folder contains base UI code, classes, libraries and generated documentation.

## Base

This is the base of the client side styles and JavaScript. In this folder we have our base includes/mixins for Sass and our base application classes for the client side code.

We also have a `_settings.scss` file located here which adds base variables to be used across the site in our stylesheets - things like branding colors, for example.

## Docs

This folder is generated by docco - ran from grunt task runner - giving us annotated documentation from all of our Coffee/JS files.

## Libs

This contains clientside libraries. We are using bower to manage our client side libraries, this folder is generated by running `grunt setup`.

## Classes

This folder contains generic classes that can be applied site-wide. Generally, this is good for icons, text formatting and other such applications.
